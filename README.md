An Agent-based Model of Taxi Passenger Travel Mode Considering  Online-taxi

The popularity of taxi-hailing apps like Uber has gradually improved current mismatching of supply with demand and reduced high transaction costs caused by information asymmetry. While an emerging industry expending the market, previous trading volume and profit share mode is bound to be reconstructed. Interest shared by multiple enterprises always unavoidably leads to malignant events, and there is no exception in the taxi industry. As the main entity of the market, passengers are those who throw the dice and influence the marketing trend. Therefore, analyzing the characteristics of taxi passengersâ€™ travel behavior is the basis of exploring the coexistence and win-win policy between these two kinds of taxi services. So, an agent-based model based on maximization of utility theory and Bayesian updating is structured to reveal factors affecting taxi passenger travel patterns and their choice between online-taxi and traditional taxi. The purpose of the simulation is to improve the understanding of the integrated network of taxi passenger travel mode when online-taxi service involves in the public transportation through a combined analysis of behavioral, spatial-temporal, economical components of travel mode. 

Information needed:
(1) Passenger Preference: from literatures.
(2) Geographic and Demographic Information: from reports and Maps
(3) Transportation information (e.g. passenger arrive rate and passenger arrive rate): from GAIA Open Dataset
